### What I learned

I learned how to use media queries effectively in order to make a website responsive. This allowed me to create the mobile design correctly.

Also i practiced my responsiveness problem solving skills by making this fully responsive alone.

```
@media (max-width: 620px) {

        .card {
            display: flex;
            flex-direction: column;
        }

        .main-section {
            display: flex;
            flex-direction: column;
            width: 100%;
            padding: 20px;
        }


        .img {
            display: none;
        }
        .img-2 {
            display: block;
            max-width: 100%;
        }
}
```
